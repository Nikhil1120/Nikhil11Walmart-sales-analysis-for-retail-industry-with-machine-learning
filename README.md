# Walmart Sales Analysis for Retail Industry with Machine Learning
This project focuses on forecasting Walmart’s sales data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical data and evaluate the impact of holidays on sales performance.



# Project Description
Sales forecasting is critical for retail businesses, and Walmart is no exception. By accurately forecasting sales, Walmart can optimize inventory management, staffing, and promotional efforts. This project leverages machine learning models to forecast weekly sales, focusing on the influence of holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day. We are provided with historical data from 45 Walmart stores, including sales data and promotional activities (markdowns), and our goal is to predict sales for upcoming weeks.

The project involves:

Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Feature engineering, including the encoding of holiday impacts.
Building multiple regression and time-series models to forecast sales.
Evaluating model performance and selecting the best algorithm.
Deploying the model as a web app using Flask, hosted on IBM Cloud.
# Objective
Forecast Walmart’s weekly sales across 45 stores.
Evaluate the impact of key holidays on sales, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day.
Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and ARIMA.
Deploy the final model as a web application for easy access and use.
# Data Description
The dataset consists of weekly sales data for 45 Walmart stores. The key features in the dataset include:

Store Information: Includes store IDs, type of store, and other metadata about each location.
Sales Data: Weekly sales data for each store, including the date, sales amount, and promotional markdown events.
Holidays: Data about holidays and special events (e.g., Christmas, Super Bowl, Thanksgiving, Labor Day) and how they affect sales.
Promotions: Data on markdowns and promotional events affecting sales during specific weeks.
The dataset includes sales data from 45 stores on a weekly basis, along with information about key holidays and their impact on sales.

# Algorithms and Models Used
The following machine learning algorithms and models are employed to predict and analyze sales data:

Random Forest Regressor: A robust ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It combines the predictions from multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
Decision Tree Regressor: A tree-based model that is simple yet effective in capturing non-linear relationships in the data.
XGBoost: An efficient implementation of gradient boosting that has gained popularity due to its performance and scalability.
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A time series forecasting method that is particularly effective for univariate data like sales time series.
The project also evaluates the impact of holidays by adding holiday markers and analyzing their influence on sales.

# Project Architecture
The architecture of this project includes multiple steps from data preprocessing to model training, testing, and deployment:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and feature engineering of the sales data.

Handling missing values.
Encoding holidays (Super Bowl, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Labor Day).
Creating new features like "Weeks Before/After Holidays."
Modeling and Training: Using the algorithms mentioned above.

Data is split into training and test sets.
Each model is trained and evaluated based on performance metrics (RMSE, MAE).
Model Evaluation:

Comparing the results of Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and ARIMA.
Selecting the best-performing model based on prediction accuracy.
Deployment:

Flask integration for creating a web interface.
Deployment of the final model on IBM Cloud to make it accessible via a web application.
# Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed.
Required Python Packages: You can install all dependencies using requirements.txt.
# Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/walmart-sales-forecasting.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd walmart-sales-forecasting
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
Data Preparation: Run data_preprocessing.py to clean and preprocess the data, including holiday encoding and feature engineering.

Model Training:

Run train_model.py to train the Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and ARIMA models.
Evaluate the model performance with evaluate_models.py.
Flask Web App:

Start the Flask application using:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start a local web server where you can interact with the model via a simple interface.
Deployment: After testing the Flask application locally, deploy it on IBM Cloud (or another cloud service) for production use. Follow the deployment instructions provided by IBM.
